        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions of Use &amp; Policy</h1>
        <p>We want you to have an amazing and safe experience with us and request that you be aware of and agree to the following information and policies:</p>

        <h2>Facilities</h2>
        <p>Amenities provided include: ear plugs, refreshments, shower facilities.</p>
        <p>It is up to each individual to take caution to prevent slipping or falling as floor surfaces may be wet. The facility is cleaned and disinfected between each session. Our float pods use a state of the art filtration system to maintain a high level of cleanliness during your float session experience. While the high saturation of Epsom Salt makes the water in the tank very sterile, three more layers of hygiene are added to ensure clean, crystal clear water — UV light purification, Hydrogen Peroxide Sterilization, and a high capacity cartridge 1 micron filter. Every ounce of water gets cycled through this system 4 times between each float.</p>

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You must be 18 years of age or 16 with a parent or guardian’s permission to float or use any other services at our facility. Some medical conditions can prevent you from floating and using infrared saunas. Please consult with your doctor. You must be able to enter and exit the room or pod unassisted in order to float at our facility.</p>
        <p><strong>Safety Procedure:</strong> For your safety after attempting to reach your room by knocking, lights, music, etc – and no response – our staff reserves the right to come into your room at any time.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation / Reschedule Policy</h2>
        <p>You must cancel scheduled sessions 48 hours in advance; otherwise, you will be charged the full fee, even if the cancellation was unavoidable.</p>
        <p>If you require to reschedule your appointment you must contact us at least 48 hours before your scheduled session. This allows our team to fill your space that your appointment originally took when scheduling, otherwise you will still be charged full amount and miss out on your appointment.</p>
        <p>If contacting 24 hours before your appointment a 25% (of the appointment amount) rescheduling fee will be applied and must be payed before moving your appointment date/time.</p>
        <p>If contacting same day as your appointment 50% (of the appointment amount) rescheduling fee will be applied and must be payed before moving your appointment date/time.</p>

        <h2>Agreement</h2>
        <p><strong>I will NOT use the flotation tank or pod if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have not showered thoroughly and still have oils, creams, or makeup on my body.</li>
          <li>I have had any type of hair color/treatment within the past two weeks.</li>
          <li>I am under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
          <li>I have a communicable or infectious skin condition, disorder, or diseases.</li>
          <li>I have open sores.</li>
          <li>I am diabetic, unless my diabetes is under medical control.</li>
          <li>I have a history of heart trouble, epilepsy, seizures or blackouts and have not received my doctor’s permission to use the flotation tank.</li>
          <li>I am experiencing a heavy menstrual period or external vaginal episode unless using proper protection.</li>
          <li>I have a skin condition which may be adversely affected by absorption of magnesium.</li>
          <li>I have kidney disease.</li>
          <li>I have incontinence, or voluntarily/involuntarily release of bodily fluids of any kind.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I understand that violation of any of these rules that results in contamination of the float tank water may result in a salt replacement fee of up to £600.00. I am choosing to use flotation therapy of my own free will and will not hold the owner/operator, Leona Bruce liable for any injury during a session or while on the premises including slips from wet floors. Leona Bruce reserves the right to refuse service to anyone. I have read, understand and agree to all of the terms and policies listed above. When booking a session you will be asked to confirm you have read and agree to this waiver and our agreement terms.</p>
